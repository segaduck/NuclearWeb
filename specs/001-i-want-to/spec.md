# Feature Specification: Resource Reservation Management System

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build up a .NET fullstack modern web application including: use vue.js as frontend, use TailwindCSS with default RWD support which can dynamic change layout arrange by different devices resolution, use .Net 9 best web app approach (but not using Blazor), use mysql as db, modern, professional UI design and have default light/dark theme instant switching, use docker compose to build up all dev env for testing. The users basic features are: content filter, calendar view for reservation status"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What core reservation actions can users perform? → A: Full CRUD - Users can create, view, edit, and cancel their own reservations
- Q: What types of resources can be reserved in this system? → A: Meeting rooms only
- Q: How should the system handle double-booking conflicts for meeting rooms? → A: Prevent - System blocks overlapping reservations for the same room at the same time
- Q: What user authentication method should the system use? → A: Username/password by default but add AD SSO/OAuth in the future
- Q: What calendar views should the system support for displaying reservations? → A: All three (day, week, month) with realtime switching and fast response time

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users need to view and manage meeting room reservations through a flexible calendar interface. They can switch between day, week, and month views to see reservations at different levels of detail, create new room bookings, edit or cancel their own existing reservations, filter displayed content to find relevant reservations quickly, switch between light and dark themes based on preference, and access the system from any device (desktop, tablet, mobile) with appropriate layout adjustments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user accesses the application, **When** they view the calendar, **Then** all current and future reservations are displayed in calendar format
2. **Given** a user is viewing the calendar, **When** they switch between day/week/month views, **Then** the view changes instantly without page reload and displays reservations appropriately for that view
3. **Given** multiple reservations exist, **When** user applies content filters, **Then** only reservations matching filter criteria are shown
4. **Given** user is on any device, **When** they access the application, **Then** the layout adapts appropriately to their screen size and orientation
5. **Given** user preferences for visual theme, **When** they toggle the theme switch, **Then** the entire interface instantly changes between light and dark modes
6. **Given** a user provides valid username and password, **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and can access the system
7. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they create a new reservation, **Then** the reservation is saved and appears in the calendar
8. **Given** a user owns a reservation, **When** they edit it, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
9. **Given** a user owns a reservation, **When** they cancel it, **Then** the reservation is marked as cancelled and updated in the calendar

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no reservations exist for the selected time period in any view (day/week/month)?
- What happens when a user attempts to create a reservation for a time slot already booked?
- What happens when a user applies filters that match no results?
- How does calendar navigation work across multiple days/weeks/months/years in each view?
- What happens when a user tries to edit a reservation to a time that conflicts with another booking?
- How does the system maintain selected date/time context when switching between views?
- How are [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: permissions/access rights] enforced?

### Key Entities

- **Reservation**: Represents a booking of a resource for a specific time period. Contains information about what is reserved, when, by whom, and current status.

- **MeetingRoom**: Represents a physical meeting room that can be reserved. Contains room name, capacity, location, amenities (e.g., projector, whiteboard), and availability rules.

- **User**: Represents people who interact with the system. Contains username, password (hashed), display name, email, preferences (theme choice), and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: role/permission information?]. Future versions will support AD SSO/OAuth integration.

- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: TimeSlot?]**: Potentially represents available booking periods if the system uses predefined time slots rather than free-form scheduling.

- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Notification?]**: If notification system is implemented, represents alerts sent to users.

## Discussion Points

I've created an initial specification based on your description, but I need clarification on several key areas:

### 1. Core Functionality - What can users do?
- Is this a view-only system or can users create/edit/cancel reservations?
- What types of resources are being reserved? (meeting rooms, equipment, etc.)
- Should the system prevent double-booking or allow overlapping reservations?

### 2. User Management
- Does the system require user login/authentication?
- Are there different user roles (admin vs regular user)?
- Should user actions be tracked/audited?

### 3. Reservation Details
- What filtering options are needed? (date range, resource type, user, status, etc.)
- What calendar views are needed? (day, week, month views?)
- Do you need recurring reservations or only single bookings?
- How should reservation conflicts be handled?

### 4. Notifications
- Should users receive notifications about their reservations?
- What notification channels? (email, in-app, SMS?)

### 5. Performance Requirements
- How many concurrent users should the system support?
- What are acceptable response times for loading and filtering?

Please provide clarification on these points so I can finalize the specification and ensure all requirements are testable and complete.

- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: Can administrators edit or cancel reservations created by other users? → A: Yes - Administrators have full control over all reservations regardless of who created them
- Q: How should the CMS handle content publishing? → A: Approval workflow - Draft content requires admin approval before publication, with available period config (start date ~ end date or forever after start date)
- Q: What is the expected number of concurrent users the system should support? → A: Small (10-50 users) - Internal team or small organization use
- Q: How should the system handle uploaded files for security? → A: Permissive - Allow most common file types (documents, images, videos, archives) with 100MB limit
- Q: How should the sidebar navigation behave on mobile devices? → A: Always visible with optional collapse - Remains visible but collapses to icon-only mode, user can manually toggle or auto-collapses when resolution width is too small

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users interact with an integrated web platform that combines meeting room reservation management and a content management system for radiation response technical team documentation. Based on their role (Normal User or Administrator), they see different navigation options in a unified sidebar. All users can switch between light and dark visual themes, access the system from any device with responsive layouts, and authenticate once to access all modules they have permission to use.

**Normal Users** primarily use the meeting room reservation calendar to view availability, book rooms, and manage their own reservations. They can also browse published content in the knowledge database.

**Administrators** have full access to both modules: they manage reservations, create/edit content articles with rich media, manage user accounts, control menu structures, and oversee file downloads.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Authentication & Navigation**
1. **Given** a user with valid credentials, **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and see a sidebar with menu items appropriate to their role
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they toggle the theme switch, **Then** the entire interface instantly changes between light and dark modes and the preference persists
3. **Given** a user accesses the system from any device, **When** the page loads, **Then** the layout adapts responsively to their screen size
4. **Given** a user on a wide screen, **When** they click the sidebar collapse button, **Then** the sidebar collapses to icon-only mode showing just icons without text labels
5. **Given** a user on a narrow screen (mobile/tablet), **When** the page loads, **Then** the sidebar automatically collapses to icon-only mode
6. **Given** a collapsed sidebar, **When** the user clicks the expand button or hovers over icons, **Then** the sidebar expands to show full text labels

**Meeting Room Reservation Module**
7. **Given** a user selects the reservation module, **When** they view the calendar, **Then** all current and future room reservations are displayed
8. **Given** a user viewing the calendar, **When** they switch between day/week/month views, **Then** the view changes instantly without page reload
9. **Given** a normal user, **When** they create a new reservation, **Then** the system checks for conflicts and either saves the reservation or displays an error if the room is already booked
10. **Given** a user owns a reservation, **When** they edit or cancel it, **Then** the changes are immediately reflected in the calendar
11. **Given** multiple reservations exist, **When** a user applies filters, **Then** only matching reservations are displayed

**CMS Module (Radiation Response Database)**
12. **Given** any user, **When** they access the knowledge database, **Then** they see a main menu with dropdown functionality displaying only published and currently available content sections
13. **Given** a user clicks a content menu item, **When** the page loads, **Then** the article is displayed with all multimedia elements (images, videos, YouTube embeds, slides) properly rendered
14. **Given** an administrator in the CMS backend, **When** they create or edit content, **Then** they can use rich text editing, embed multimedia, save as draft, and the frontend display matches their backend formatting
15. **Given** an administrator, **When** they review draft content, **Then** they can approve it for publication and set its available period (start date to end date, or start date with no end)
16. **Given** content with a defined available period, **When** the current date is outside that period, **Then** the content is not visible to users on the frontend
17. **Given** an administrator, **When** they manage menus, **Then** they can add, edit, or remove main menu items and content menu items
18. **Given** an administrator, **When** they manage accounts, **Then** they can create, modify, or deactivate user accounts and assign roles
19. **Given** an administrator, **When** they manage files, **Then** they can upload files for download and users can download them from the frontend

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access a module they don't have permission for?
- How does the system handle a reservation conflict when two users try to book the same room at the same time?
- What happens when no content exists in the CMS database?
- How does the system handle large multimedia files (videos, slide presentations)?
- What happens when a user's role is changed while they're logged in?
- How are deleted content items handled if they're referenced in menus?
- What happens when calendar filters return no results?
- How does the system behave when switching between modules (state preservation)?
- What happens when content's available period expires while a user is viewing it?
- What happens to menu items linked to content that is outside its available period?
- Can draft content be edited by the original author before approval?

## Discussion Points

I've created an initial specification for your integrated multi-module platform. This system combines two major functional areas with shared infrastructure. However, I need clarification on several key areas:

### 1. User Management & Security
- Session timeout and "remember me" functionality?
- Password complexity requirements?
- Administrator ability to reset user passwords?
- Which user account fields are editable?

### 2. Meeting Room Reservation Details
- Can administrators edit/cancel any reservation?
- What filter criteria are needed (date range, room, user, status)?
- Support for recurring reservations?
- What reservation statuses exist?
- Should rooms have booking restrictions (max hours, advance limits)?
- Need purpose/description field for reservations?

### 3. CMS Content Management
- Specific rich text formatting capabilities needed?
- Presentation slide format and viewer (PDF, PowerPoint)?
- Content versioning and change tracking?
- Draft/publish workflow or immediate publication?
- Multi-level menu hierarchy or just two levels?
- How to handle orphaned content when menus are deleted?
- Content categorization (tags, categories)?

### 4. File Management
- File size limits?
- Allowed/restricted file types for security?
- File organization method (folders, categories, tags)?
- Who can access files (all users or role-based)?
- Track download activity?

### 5. Navigation & UX
- Sidebar behavior on mobile (collapse, slide-out drawer)?
- Performance targets (load times, concurrent users)?

### 6. Data & Compliance
- Audit logging for security/compliance?
- Backup strategy and retention?
- Notification system for events?

Please provide clarification on these points so I can finalize the specification and ensure all requirements are testable and complete.
